# Hiring-Process-Analytics
Hiring process is the fundamental and the most important function of a company. Here, the MNCs get to know about the major underlying trends about the hiring process. Trends such as- number of rejections, number of interviews, types of jobs, vacancies etc. are important for a company to analyse before hiring freshers or any other individual. Thus, making an opportunity for a Data Analyst job here too!  

Here we will use EDA to find out different insights and to answer the questions asked by the 
company to answer certain questions making sense out of the data. **Exploratory Data Analysis** 
(EDA) is an approach to analyzing the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover 
trends, and patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summaries and 
graphical representations.  

Steps for EDA
1. Understanding data columns and data
2. Checking for missing data
3. Clubbing columns with multiple categories

From the given dataset I have answered some of the following questions using statistics and 
different formulas in MS Excel:  

1. **Hiring:** How many males and females are Hired?  
2. **Average Salary:** What is the average salary offered in this company?  
3. **Class Intervals:** Draw the class intervals for salary in the company?  
4. **Charts and Plots:** Draw Pie Chart / Bar Graph (or any other graph) to show proportion of 
people working different department?  
5. **Charts:** Represent different post tiers using chart/graph
